## üöÄ How It Works (Simplified)

1. You submit a long URL
2. The FastAPI app saves it to PostgreSQL and gives you a short code
3. When someone clicks your short link:
   - FastAPI finds the original URL and redirects them instantly
   - It creates a background task to log the click
   - A Celery worker (using Redis) processes this task in the background
4. You can see the total clicks and a simple chart on your dashboard
